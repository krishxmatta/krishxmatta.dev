I'm Krish Matta. This website serves as both an outlet for me to haphazardly share some of my thoughts and a great exercise to improve my writing style.


## Work {#work}

I'm a student at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. While my degree title states computer science, I'm interested in much more. I have worked for/collaborated with: NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (2022), University of Delaware Safro Research Group (2021 - 2023), and Roblox (2023).
