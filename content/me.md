I'm Krish Matta.


## Work {#work}

I'm a student at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, majoring in computer science. I have worked for/collaborated with: NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (2022), University of Delaware Safro Research Group (2021 - 2023), and Roblox (2023).


## Personality {#personality}

I would describe myself as optimistic, introverted, and ambitious. My scores on the [Big Five Personality personality traits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits), according to [YourMorals](https://yourmorals.org/), are:

1.  Openness: 74%.
2.  Conscientiousness: 82%.
3.  Extraversion: 25%.
4.  Agreeableness: 56%.
5.  Neuroticism: 42%.


## Interests {#interests}

My academic interests are broad, spanning computer science, mathematics, philosophy, literature, and history. While most of my time is spent on computer science, I'm a strong proponent of the idea that one's knowledge should be "T-shaped," with the horizontal bar representing knowledge over a breadth of subjects and the vertical bar representing a large depth of knowledge in a single subject. Ultimately, I hope to contribute to the creation of safe artificial general intelligence.

On a more casual note, I also enjoy strategy games (particularly card games), puzzles, hip-hop, instrumental music, photography (nature, architectural, landscape), and gardening.
