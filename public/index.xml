      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Krish Matta.
Work I&amp;rsquo;m a student at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. While my degree title states computer science, I&amp;rsquo;m interested in much more. I have worked for/collaborated with: NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (2022), University of Delaware Safro Research Group (2021 - 2023), and Roblox (2023).

      <description>This site serves as both an outlet for me to haphazardly share some of my thoughts and an exercise to improve my writing style.
Technical Aspects Hosting This site is hosted on GitHub Pages, and consequently managed using git. Its repository is available here.
Workflow Hugo is used as a static site generator to easily maintain fine-grained control over the site without having to directly manage its HTML. All content on the website originates as an Org file created in Emacs, as it is my preferred editor.</description>
